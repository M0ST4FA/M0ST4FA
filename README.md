- 👋 Hi, I’m M0sT4fa (Mostafa Beder), a medical student based in Egypt (as of 2024.)
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, especially compiler design. I'm also interested in mathematics, science in general, linguistics, and languages (I know English and Spanish.)
- 🌱 I'm currently focusing on learning more about computer science instead of programming. E.g., as of this writing, I'm learning Software Architecture and Design Patterns.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any C/C++ project that I have enough knowledge and experience to collaborate on, given that I have time of course.
- 📫 My email is mostafa2018a3s@gmail.com, although don't expect a quick reply (I barely open it.)
