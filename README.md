- 👋 Hi, I’m M0sT4fa (Mostafa Beder), a medical student based in Egypt.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, especially compiler design. I'm also interested in mathematics, science in general, linguistics, and languages (I speak English and Spanish fluently, as well as Arabic, my native language.)
- 🌱 I'm currently focusing on learning more practical things, like popular frameworks in c++. In the past I've focused on more theoretical things, which I figured out is not the best thing to do 😔.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any C/C++ project on whose theme I have enough knowledge and experience, given that I have time (which I don't right, at this point of my life 😔).
- 📫 You can contact me at [this gmail address](mostafa2018a3s@gmail.com) or [this one](dr.mostafabideer@gmail.com), although don't expect a quick reply (I barely open them and don't know why I have two in the first place.) I don't have any other social media accounts, besides Google.
