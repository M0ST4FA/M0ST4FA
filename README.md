- 👋 Hi, I’m M0sT4fa (Mostafa Beder), a medical student based in Egypt (as of 2024.)
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, especially compiler design. I'm also interested in mathematics, science in general, linguistics, and languages.
- 🌱 I have a broad spectrum of interests. Things I'm currently learning include discrete mathematics, C++, and more practical computer science topics until I get enough time to learn more theoretical parts. I'm also learning English and Spanish.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any C/C++ project that I have enough knowledge and experience to collaborate on, given that I have time of course.
- 📫 My email is mostafa2018a3s@gmail.com, although don't expect a quick reply (I barely open it.)
